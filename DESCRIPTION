Description: This package computes two reliability coefficients. Britt's
    nu is used to assess reliability for data sets composed of multiple
    Dirichlet-distributed samples. Euclidean Krippendorff's alpha is used
    to assess reliability for Euclidean and compositional data that do not
    necessarily adhere to a Dirichlet distribution. These measures are
    especially useful for the cross-validation of topic models.
